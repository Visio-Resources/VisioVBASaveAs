# Addon to allow Visio VBA to do a "Save As"

There is no built-in dialog in Visio VBA to do a Save As. So, I have created an addon that can do this.
Download the .zip file below, unzip it and run the .msi file contained within. This will install the addon in Visio.
Now download the test.zip file below and unzip it into your My Shapes folder. Open this file and look at the macro "SaveAs".
Edit the contents of the string "SaveAddress" to change the default location and name where the file is saved to.
